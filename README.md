Feature Scaling
-
- Feature scaling is the process of transforming numerical features in your dataset so they are on a similar scale.
- Itâ€™s important because:
  - Many algorithms (like KNN, SVM, logistic regression, neural networks, gradient descent-based models) are sensitive to the magnitude of features.
  - Without scaling, features with large numerical ranges can dominate distance-based metrics or optimization steps.
